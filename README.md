# Axess
Create and carry out assessments

# Description
This website project aims to create a one page online application that allows users to register as a "Teacher" or a "Student". 

As a "Teacher", a person shoul be able to create assessments and review all the previously created ones, as well as delete any of them. 
<br/>As a "Student", a user should be allowed to find a given assessment, carry it out, and once submitted, be presented with the final score.

The project is subdivided in two main directories: frontend (written in React), and backend (written in Django).

# Project State
At the moment, the Teacher side of the project has been implemented through a first iteration, giving a first prototype of the final result. The next step will be to implement the Student side, and finally an authentication system.
